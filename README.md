# PDF Splitter Tool

I have created a PDF splitting utility tool which can used by anyone to split
their PDFs in anyway they want. The user just has to upload the PDF file to split, specify the page numbers,
file names of the new PDFs, or can use a default naming format provided on the website.

This tool can be very useful where, we want to split PDF files of many pages.
After submitting, an automatic download of a zip file will start, which the user can open,
it will contain all the splitted PDF files as per the naming convention.

It is very easy to use for any user as all the steps are clearly expalined
and function is also provided to autoname files, so that user does not have to manually name all files.


## Libraries Used

I have used Python 3 Programming language, both for the Frontend and Backend part.

In this project, I have used the PyPDF2 library for manipulating the PDF file as well as Flask library for the frontend.

For more info on all libraries, please refer the requirement.txt file.
